a try to make a build tool which is easiest to use than maven, gradle etc.

actualy java has a big problem. **JAVA DONT HAS A BUILD TOOL**, or atleast a good and simple to use build tool. java build tool or are very complex to use (maven, gradle...) or are a bit ugly (bld). this is my try to make a build tool which is a bit simple to use.

as java developer i had six options.

1. learn maven. which is a lot complex and **is unstable**, of course.
2. learn graddle. is a lot, very lot confuse. in my opnion graddle is more hard to use even than maven, maybe because maven is declarative instead a scripting build tool.
3. learn ant. boring. realy. i dont wanna do everything manualy. ant is a lot manual.
4. learn bld. yeah there the bld build tool. but i had some problem when i have try to use local jars. and it is not simple enough. a problem similar as maven.
5. write your own build tool. this is the most complex option.
6. i realy thought the best option was to use "make" or even just bash scripts.
   realy, "maven" and "graddle" are bad.

i have created this build tool for myself. this build tool is part of my java learning. if anyone is reading this and wanna improve this project or even have a alternative build tool easy to use would be good to know.

because i'm dumb this project must contains a lot of bugs and problems. and probably is best to use any of the alternatives above.
