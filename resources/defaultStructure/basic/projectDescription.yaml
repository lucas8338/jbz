# MANDATORY

# string, the name of your project. this should not contains space character because this will be used as default name formated
# the generated ".jar" files.
name: helloWorldProject
# string, the version.
version: 0.0.1.0
# string, the initial point of a ".jar" file.
# if your project dont have a initial point then let it as a empty string ("").
mainClass: "helloWorld.HelloWorld"
# string, a short description of your project.
description: yourProjectDescription
# string, the author name.
author: yourName
# string, the project url.
url: yourUrl

# practically a simple usage dont require to touch anything bellow
# when needing to touch anything generally will be the "class-path" field to add a new class-path.

# informations which are used internally by the builder.
# this field work very similar to "variables".
# which will be used by the builder.
# example:
# internal:
#   main:
#       src: string, the directory where '.java' files are located. will get the files recursively.
#       compileOutput: string, the directory where the compiled code of the 'src' (main) is located.
#       javadocOutput: string, the directory where the javadoc output will be stored.
#       resources: string, the directory where the resources are located. the content of this directory will be copied to the root of a jar and a jar with depencencies generated.
#       jarPath: string, the path where to save the generated jar. this path can use formated strings: "\\{anyKeyInThisDocument.SeparatedByDot.forSubKey}".
#       jarPathWithDependencies: string, the path where to save the generated jar with dependencies, this pat can use formated strings: "\\{anyKeyInThisDocument.SeparatedByDot.forSubKey}".
#   tests:
#       src: string, the directory where '.java' files are located. will get the files recursively.
#       compileOutput: string, the directory where the compiled code of the 'tests' (tests) is located.
#       javadocOutput: string, the directory where store the javadoc output.
